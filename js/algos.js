// psuedocode - rel 0

// 		Function: takes an array of words or phrases, returns the longest word or phrase in the array
// 
// take an array of strings,
// make a variable to store the index of the longest string, initialize it to 0 (which is also the first element in the array)
// loop through the strings, do the following:
// check the length of the current string, store that in a variable
// if the length of the current string is longer than the length of the previous longest string, 
// update the longest-string-index to the current index
// 
// after the loop, the longest string index will be that of the longest string
// print out that string with our final index
