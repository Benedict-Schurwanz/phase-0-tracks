# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts. M'kay?

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
	Version control allows us to view a history of revisions to a code project, and to manage revisions made independently by different people. It facilitates one or more people working on smaller more specific segments of code or features of a program while preserving a base of working code. It also allows rolling back to previous versions to find errors. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
	A branch creates a copy of a repository and everything that's committed already, to allow you to make changes without altering the original repository, which is usually in the master branch. Different people can work on different branches at the same time.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
	A commit is like a save point that lets you add changes to specific files to an entry in the version history. A good commit messages describes what changes were made, clearly and succinctly. 
* What is a merge conflict?
	When the same thing is changed different ways in two different branches, there is a merge conflict because the changes are contradictory.
