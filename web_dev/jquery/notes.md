# Make a Plan - learning jQuery in 2 hours

* google jquery, select 3 resources that seem easy to understand yet detailed
* find 1 cheat sheet for reference 

* how often should you stop and test what you've learned? "as-needed...?" I'm not sure.

* use Pomodoro and stick to it, have something handy that can be done on a 5 minute break, something else that can be done for 20 minutes after the 1st hour
* turn off your phone, don't look at your email, 
* have a notes file open for 'things to look at later' to jot a random thought in and then go back to work
* working in half-hour chunks is okay


# Findings

## Sources: 
* jquery.com - jQuery API documentation
* jQuery tutorial at w3schools.com

## Notes
* can be downloaded as a .js file and included in projects, or linked to via a content delivery network (CDN) which would download it to the browser when the page is loaded 







# Results

* it seemed to be most effective to find sources like tutorials that explained the concepts in plain language, and to move on from a particular source if it was too confusing. 
* It also helps to take a break when the information isn't sinking in, or just change things up so I don't get in a mental rut of figuratively banging my head against my desk
