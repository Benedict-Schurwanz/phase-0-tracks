- get name
- swap first and last name 
	# change string to array of words, reverse it, change it back to a string
- Change all vowels to next vowel ("aeiou") and consonants to next consonant
	# make strings vowels = "aeiou" and consonants = "bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz", and/or arrays vowels_array and consonants_array
	# if letter is in vowels - use the method that finds if it's a member of that array/string - then get the index of vowels where the letter is, and change the letter in the string to the next letter in the array; if it's in consonants do that with consonants array
	# if it's the last letter - 'z' or 'u' - it needs to wrap around to the first letter
