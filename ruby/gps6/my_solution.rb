# Virus Predictor
# my name: Benedict Schurwanz
# I worked on this challenge with: Greg McGough.
# We spent [1] hours on this challenge working together, not including answering reflections afterwards.

# EXPLANATION OF require_relative
# require_relative uses a relative path compared to where the file is, 
# require needs an absolute path
require_relative 'state_data'

=begin # Reflection Section

Release 9:
- the inner hashes use symbols as keys, the rocket notation in the outer hash allows strings to be keys. In this case it is more convenient to have strings for the names of the states than trying to use symbols 
- require_relative uses a relative path compared to where the current file is -- if it's in the same directory no path is needed -- require would need to have the complete specific path explicitly stated
- hash.each works, hash.length.times, or while a counter is less than hash.length
- the variables were already class attributes so they did not need to be passed into the methods as arguments, Ã¥s attributes they are accessible to all methods within the class
- the concept of private methods
